This repository contains the automatic speaker verification training/inference code from the Acoustic, Speech Signal Processing and Machine Learning (ASML) Lab. of Hanyang University.

Our work is based on VoxCeleb trainer from NAVER corpus, please refer to [LICENSE_clovaai.md](/LICENSE_clovaai.md) for details.

Code for other datasets other than VoxCeleb will be added. 

### model & loss

model and loss are organized into three folders: asml/clova/custom.

* The "asml" is our own work and the "clova" is the same as the those in the VoxCeleb trainer.

* "custom" contains what we are developing based on other researchers' work.
